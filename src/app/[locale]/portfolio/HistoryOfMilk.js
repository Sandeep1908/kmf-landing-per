                    <p>The history of milk is a fascinating journey that intertwines with the evolution of human civilization and the domestication of animals. As early humans transitioned from a nomadic lifestyle to settled agricultural communities, the realization that certain animals could provide a steady supply of milk marked a pivotal moment. </p> <br />

                    <p>The domestication of animals like cows, goats, and sheep was a transformative development. These animals not only provided meat and hides but also became a reliable source of milk. This discovery had profound implications for human nutrition, allowing communities to thrive on a more varied and sustainable diet.</p> <br />

                    <p>Ancient civilizations, from Mesopotamia to Egypt and the Indus Valley, embraced dairy farming. In Sumeria, the goddess Ninhursag was revered as the goddess of milk, emphasizing the cultural and symbolic importance attached to this nutritious substance. Similarly, Egyptian art depicted scenes of milking and dairy processing, showcasing the centrality of milk in their daily lives.</p>

                <p>He was originally from Kolar district who was very concerned about the farmers. He was born in a village called Motakapalli in Mulbagilu taluk. Date 01.06.1918 is his birthday. He entered politics at one stage and was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1952. Central government led by Jawaharlal Nehru M.V.K. He was given the opportunity to serve as "Agriculture and Food Minister". It was a time when the dairy farmers of the state relied on indigenous breeds of cattle for dairying. Mr. M.V.K said that if dairy farming continues like this, it will be difficult to meet the demand for milk from cities/towns. He had thought in those days. When he was a minister in the Union Cabinet, he had visited many foreign countries and was amazed to see the milk production capacity of the breeds there. Not only that, he had imported HF breed heifers from Holland and distributed them to the farmers here. With the aim of developing the country's native breed heifers through artificial insemination, he got help from the central government and succeeded in importing 8 to 10 foreign breed bulls to Karnataka. He worked hard to increase milk production through breeding activities in Mysore, Bangalore, Mangalore and some areas of the hill country. Perhaps about dairy farming Mr. M.V.K. It is a fact that due to the influence of the foresight of Mr. R., the situation is now created that wherever you go in the entire state, you are driven by crossbred horses. </p>
